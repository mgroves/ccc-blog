This episode is **different** than a normal episode of Cross Cutting Concerns!

1. This episode is about an R-Rated movie! Normally my podcast is G-rated, but that is not the case for this episode. If you normally listen with children, I recommend you listen to link:http://podcast.storypirates.com/[Story Pirates] with them instead!
2. This is a **long** episode: almost an hour. Normally my episodes are around 15 minutes.
3. This is an episode about a (vaguely) technical/computer related movie. I've done a couple of episodes like this in the past: link:https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/Podcast-071-Bill-Sempf-on-Sneakers[071 - Bill Sempf on Sneakers] and link:https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/Podcast-036---Kevin-Groves-on-Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley[036 - Kevin Groves on Pirates of Silicon Valley].

Show Notes:

* We watched link:https://www.amazon.com/Office-Space-Jennifer-Aniston/dp/B0093CNAJY[Office Space], a 1999 film by Mike Judge. If you haven't watched it, you should!
* Inside joke alert: the mention of a "white jimmy". This is a reference to a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_S-10_Blazer[GMC Jimmy SUV] that's painted white. But suppose someone came up to you and said "I have a white Jimmy" and then paused for 15 seconds...
* There are many tangents we go on in this episode. Confused? link:https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/podcast[Send me a question], and I will try to clarify.
* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBxYXeu55k[K*Pax] - a film you've probably never heard of starring Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, and (notable for this podcast) Ajay Naidu.
* Speaking of Kevin Spacey, if you're out of the loop, you might want to read up on link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp[Anthony Rapp].
* The video discussed briefly in the episode is link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwy2zRilRl0[7 Things You (Probably) Didn't Know About Office Space]
* link:https://www.adultswim.com/[Adult Swim] is the late night block of Cartoon Network that showed link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqrv6A3aPAQ[King of the Hill] in syndication.

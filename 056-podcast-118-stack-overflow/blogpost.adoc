Show Notes:

* This episode is a bit different than normal episodes. It's an informal discussion of the Stack Overflow survey results by two people who are not and have never been Stack Overflow employees. We discuss a few things that stood out to us, but we barely scratch the surface of all the data that you can dig through. Make sure to check out the survey results yourself for the entire picture!

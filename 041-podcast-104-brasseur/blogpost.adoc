* link:https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-concept-utility-microeconomics.asp[Utility] is a concept brought from time to time in link:http://www.econtalk.org/[EconTalk], one of my favorite podcasts.
* In this episode, VM discusses Microsoft's patents. **This episode was recorded BEFORE the announcement** from link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-open-sources-its-entire-patent-portfolio/[Microsoft joining the Open Invention Network]. (This is one of the reasons I like to say the date of the recording at the top of every episode). I did *not* reach out to VM to get any further comment on this event.
* link:https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/23/redis_database_license_change/[Redis licensing changes]. We had an extended discussion about Redis licensing that I cut just due to time constraints, but definitely reach out to VM if you have questions!
* Something else that happened since this podcast was recorded: link:https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-mongodbs-turn-to-change-its-open-source-license/[MongoDB made a license change]. I think it's similar to Redis's change, but I'm not entirely sure.

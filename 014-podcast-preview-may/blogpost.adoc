The podcast keeps rolling in May, with more great guests!

*Reminders:*

* Be sure to check out my sponsor: link:https://smartsheet.com/crosscuttingconcerns[Smartsheet]! Thanks to them, I'm able to afford some new equipment, more hosting, and the JavaScript game show prizes!
* If you're enjoying the new JavaScript game show, link:https://crosscuttingconcerns.com/Contact[please send in your suggestions]. I'm running out of ideas, and you and your ideas could be featured on this show. I need real __and__ made-up suggestions! The sillier the names, the better.
* I rarely talk about this, but if you would be so kind as to *tell a friend* about the show, *post about it on Facebook or Twitter*, and *leave a review* on iTunes or Google Play or wherever else, I would be forever grateful!

Here's what's coming in March:

* My good pal Calvin Allen is back, talking about a potpourri of topics on his mind.
* The great Doc Norton talking about the experimentation mindset.
* James Munns talking about embedded programming.
* The legendary David Neal returns to talk about his artwork, which has taken over Twitter lately.
* And maybe, just maybe, one extra special episode this month.

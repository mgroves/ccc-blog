* Instead, consider link:https://jasperfx.github.io/lamar/[Lamar] for your IoC container needs.

* At one point I was rambling about ASP.NET Core's inability to use the service locator pattern. Some quick points:
** Don't use Service Locator, there are lots of other better patterns to use.
** DO NOT DO IT.
** If you absolutely need it: here's a link:https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2018/05/06/servicelocator-shim-for-net-core/[blog post about it].
** I was incorrect in the podcast by making a sweeping statement about ASP.NET Core not having service locator. But for a very specific, narrow case where I wanted to use the service locator pattern recently, I was unable to do so. This might have been my own failing, or something that just isn't possible with the built-in ASP.NET IoC. I have not tried this very specific, narrow use case with Lamar yet.
* I plugged my book, link:https://www.manning.com/books/aop-in-net[AOP in .NET] yet again.
* Lamar is named after link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabeau_B._Lamar[Mirabeau Lamar] (a hero of the Texas revolution)
